Learning to use Theano by playing with the NOAA whale recognition data ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition)).

Status: unstable, under active development.

Notes: if using numpy 1.10.0, you may need to edited Theano's source code per [this commit](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/commit/bdcb752aa9abcaf8a7fb1e8e56d981e9bc151058).
